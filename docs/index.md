# 1. Strudying Platform
This project was made by a team of three that I led (credits to Ioana Vijoli and Bogdan Zagan).
We worked really hard to make this project and I can proudly say that we outdone ourselves;
Description:
It is a desktop application made in JavaFX that connects to a database and serves as a studying platform where students and teachers can log in and interact with each other.
Details:
Those with administrator rights can create courses and perform CRUD operation on users.
The professors can schedule different activities(lab, lecture, seminar), they can grade students, set weights to different grades that made up the final grade, as well as many other things.
The students can join and quit courses, they can make studying groups where they can chat can schedule different activities (like studing sessions).
